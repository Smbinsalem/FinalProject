- Why is it a problem?
- Who is affected by this problem?
- How does your project address this problem?
- What aspects of it are you trying to solve?
- Pitch your solution.

DEMO: This is where you show us your prototype.

- Walk us through the project.
- Tell us a story from the perspective of the main users.
- Do not take us on a feature tour of your Trello board.
- Do not highlight trivial features like login and signup.

Technical Achievements:

- Are there any interesting things you’re doing in the backend or frontend?
- What are some of the challenges you faced and how did you solve them?
- Do not show us any code.

Future Plans:

- Where do you want to take this project if you were to continue working on it?
- Keep in mind that your audience are mostly non-technical people. So keep the technical talk as basic as possible.
